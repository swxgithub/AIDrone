If you want to edit/play yourself:

git clone https://github.com/swxgithub/AIDrone.git
cd AIDrone
npm install
You may want to add --depth=1 to the git clone command because there are some large files in the git repository history.

Running the project requires Node.js to be installed.

Open a Command Prompt or Terminal in the repository and run:

npm start
Then go to http://localhost:8601/ - the playground outputs the default GUI component
